- branch by abstraction
- multiple systems live / canary / service mesh/ proxies
  - traffic shifting
  - blue/ green
- strangler pattern
- always green
- small changes
- test isolation
- write code to be observable
- smart monitoring ( few metrics)
- exception tracking - automate test creation
- different logging patterns. 
- deploy vs release and deployment strategies
- post release analysis / update code and alerts
- contract testing
- isolated integration testing
- always support the previous configuration
- chaos engineering - how to write code to survive a broken / overloaded dependency.
