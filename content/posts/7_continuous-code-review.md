# Pair or Mob Programing



### How does this apply to me as a developer?

- Always pair when you can. You want to avoid dead time by waiting for code reviews. Instead advocate for code reviews during the pairing.
- During the pairing, you will talk about what you are doing, how you are doing it, and [why you are doing it](/posts/2_continuous-planning). By reviewing the code during the session, you also [review the plan](/posts/3_continuous-certification).
