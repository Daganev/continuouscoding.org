There are numerous ways to define the feedback loop of planning. All of them have the same goal of generating the big picture.

- LEAN
- Agile
- Scrum
- SAFe
- Less
- BDD
- DDD

As a Continuous Coder the how is less important than participating and speaking up if requirements and planning aren't clear.  If you don't know why you are working on something, you will be less able to speak up and fix problems that only you are in a position to notice.

You may not have the authority, but you do have the responsibility. 

### How does this apply to me as a developer?

 - [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) is most applicable during the feature definition phase of software development. This means that when practicing continuous coding, the language of the organization, and therefore the language of the variables and classes used within your code is going to be highly correlated to how features are organized.

 - For example, if you are working in a LEAN environment, your code will likely be set up as experiments, quick to throw away or be rewritten. If working in an Agile environment your code might be focused around UseCase Classes with the execute() function.
