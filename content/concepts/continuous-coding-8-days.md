What does coding life look like when you are a continuous coder?
Well, as the Beatles once said, "8 days a week, I love you." That's what many people think of when they hear of continuous coding for the first time.
But we are here to offer a better way. 2 weeks for a sprint is a pretty good lenght of time. And as a continuous coder, you'll be able to make those sprints 8 days long.
Let's work towards 8 days a sprint. It might be enough to show you how much I care.

Over the next 8 articles, we will describe in great detail how a sprint might go, with a few detours to show alternate timelines.

But first, let's spell out an ideal schedule:
* `Pomodoro  = 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5 minute break.`  
Below is an idealized schedule for every day of the week.

The schedule will obviously vary each day, and we will explore those variations in each post.  
This means that each day, if you are well disciplined, you will deploy 12 times.   
On some days, when you are tired and careless, you'll deploy more than 12.    
On most days, when you are alert and cautious and thinking, you'll probably only want to deploy 3 times.
