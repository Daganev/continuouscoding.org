Certification has gotten a bad reputation, but if approached correctly, it's invaluable.

Why do we write acceptance tests, and user stories? So we can certify our programs.

Why should we take [certification exams](/resources/tests), so we can validate our skill sets before moving forward.

Know what you want to do, and know that you can do it.
