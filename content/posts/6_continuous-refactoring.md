### How does this apply to me as a developer?

- This entire section is all about being a developer. The real question is; How does this apply to other team members?
- For the team leads. Every step in the red/green/refactor cycle should be quick. If it's not quick you don't have a [good plan](/posts/2_continuous-planning)
- For QA.  Get involved with the testing plans early. Prepare the end to end and acceptance tests which the TDD cycle can enhance.  This lets the TDD cycle focus on variations that will not be handled by most higher level tests, especially the error path.
- For everyone on the team. Test first. Know where you are going first. Have your expected outputs before you start "work".
